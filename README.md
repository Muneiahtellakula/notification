# notification
Sometimes you want your app to show information to users even when the app isn't running in the foreground. For example, you might want to let users know that new content is available, or that their favorite sports team just scored a goal in a game. The Android notification framework provides a way for your app to notify users even when the app is not in the foreground.  A notification is a message that your app displays to the user outside of your app's normal UI. Notifications appear as icons in the device's notification area, which is in the status bar. To see the details of a notification, the user opens the notification drawer, for example by swiping down on the status bar. The notification area and the notification drawer are system-controlled areas that the user can view at any time.  On devices running Android 8.0 and higher, when your app has a new notification to show to the user, your app icon automatically shows a badge. (Badges are also called notification dots). When the user long-presses the app icon, the notification appears above the app icon, as shown in the screenshot below.
